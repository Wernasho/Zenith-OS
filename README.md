# Zenith-OS
Zenith OS is a Lightweight, CLI based, developer-focused OS made mainly with C (like practically every other OS out there);

Route hierarchy: 
***$:*** '$' In Zenith OS is the "Master" Folder. It's the disk the OS is installed in.
***$ > #:*** '>' in Zenith OS separates directories, like '\' in windows. "#" is the "Brain" folder, which contains some important subfolder like def-apps (default apps)
***$ > desktop:*** No need to explain.
